## Preamble

I have been intending to write a blog for some time.

This is to help me understand my own ideas about the papers I read. As such, most of the material on this blog is just a reworking of other peoples ideas, perhaps in a different context, or with comparisons drawn with others work. To this end, I am interested in feedback and input on clarifications, corrections, errata, emendations and so on. 

In particular, I'm interested in a examining the detail of Simon Wardley's mapping framework in greater detail. Most of these early posts are going to be about interpreting many of the other works in the literature in the context of a map. For those, that don't know the background to this, begin reading [On being lost](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec) The appeal of this framework is that it views a business model as a directed graph in a metric or ordinal space - but more on that at a later date.
