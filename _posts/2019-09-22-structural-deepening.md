## Preamble

I have been intending to write a blog for some time.

This is to help me understand my own ideas about the papers I read, talks I hear, and increasingly importantly the social media threads I view. 

As such, most of the material on this blog is just a reworking of other peoples ideas, perhaps in a different context, or with comparisons drawn with the work of others. I hope it is all referenced correctly. To this end, I am interested in feedback and input on clarifications, corrections, errata, emendations and so forth. 

I currently work in different fields, from machine learning, to law, and in different contexts from formal education to to working with startups. This blog is focused on my interest in the different mechanisms of invention, innovation and the evolution of technology. Most of my recent discussions in these matter have been with Dave Chapman at the UCL School of Management.    

In particular, I'm interested in a examining Simon Wardley's mapping framework in greater detail. Most of these early posts are going to be about interpreting many of the other works in the (predominantly management science) literature in the context of a map. 

For those of you that don't know the background to this, begin reading  [On being lost](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec) to learn more about it. 

The appeal of this mapping framework is that it views a business model as a directed graph in a metric or ordinal space - this appeals to me for several reasons - but more on that at a later date.

# The structure of invention

These series of posts are on the detail of transitions between different technologies. In future posts, this will touch on subjects such as *technical debt* or *obsolescence* but to start with I want to introduce some terminology from the work of others. 

The x-axis of a Wardley Map (Figure 1 below) measures the maturity of different component technologies [^1].

[^1]: Following [Wardley 2016](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/finding-a-new-purpose-8c60c9484d3b), Figure 76, this is in principle done by assessing the language used to describe the technology in various corpora that refer to it. From academic publications, to patents, to standards bodies documentation and finally to marketing collateral, sales manuals and so forth. I will write more on this in future posts.

To start with, looking at Figure 1 we can see that a component moves from left to right as it matures. Initially, on the left in the *Genesis stage* it has been *kludged* together from existing components or assemblies of components. For example, according to Arthur (2009 p. 131)[^arthur2009], Lawrence's first [cyclotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron) was assembled from parts that included a kitchen chair, a clothes tree, window glass, sealing wax and brass fittings! The technology or component[^2] then begins its journey along a path of development which is shown by arrow going left to right in the Wardley Map. 

[^2]: Following Arthur (2007 p. 276)[^arthur2007] I will use I will use the word technology and component interchangeably in this blog quite simply as a means to fulfill a human purpose. The word technology has two other legitimate meanings: a body of practices and components, and “the totality of the means employed by a people to provide itself with the objects of material culture (Arthur, 2007, p. 276)[^arthur2007].

We can imagine think about the component 

Invention is not an event signaled by some striking breakthrough. It is process – usually a lengthy and untidy one – of linking a purpose with a principle (some generic use ofan effect) that will satisfy it. This linkage stretches from the need itself to the base phenomenon that will be harnessed to meet it, through supporting solutions and sub-solutions and the grammars of each.

**Figure 2. Evolution of a component from past to present through different realisations 1-3. At each stage of development the technology must be made reliable, improved, scaled up and adapted to purposes. As we move from 1-3 engineers can test better techniques, solve problems, and eke out improvements.**


## Purposed systems 

A principle by contrast (as I will use the word) is the idea of use of a phenomenon for some purpose,

(1) A technology fulfills some expressed purpose – some need – personally or socially perceived. (2) A technology is built always around the reliable exploitation of some base phenomenon as envisaged through some principle of use. (3) A technology requires other sub-principles (and therefore sub-components) for its practical working.

Technologies are put together or combined from component parts or assemblies

Technologies consist of parts - assemblies or sub-assemblies - that are themselves technologies. W. Brian Arthur talks about the recursive structure of technologies. In \cite{} pp. he refers to

It the next post we'll look at different paths for the evolution of the main assembly to help us understand why do some new technologies emerge and quickly supplant incumbent technologies while others take years or decades to take off. We explore the framework of Adner and Kapoor (2016)[^adnerKapoor2016]that considers both the focal competing technologies as well as the ecosystems in which they are embedded.
