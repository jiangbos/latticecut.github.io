## Preamble

I have been intending to write a blog for some time.

This is to help me understand my own ideas about the papers I read, talks I hear, and increasingly importantly the social media threads I view. 

As such, most of the material on this blog is just a reworking of other peoples ideas, perhaps in a different context, or with comparisons drawn with the work of others. I hope it is all referenced correctly. To this end, I am interested in feedback and input on clarifications, corrections, errata, emendations and so forth. 

I currently work in different fields, from machine learning, to law, and in different contexts from formal education to to working with startups. This blog is focused on my interest in the different mechanisms of invention, innovation and the evolution of technology. Most of my recent discussions in these matter have been with Dave Chapman at the UCL School of Management.    

In particular, I'm interested in a examining Simon Wardley's mapping framework in greater detail. Most of these early posts are going to be about interpreting many of the other works in the (predominantly management science) literature in the context of a map. 

For those of you that don't know the background to this, begin reading  [On being lost](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec) to learn more about it. 

The appeal of this mapping framework is that it views a business model as a directed graph in a metric or ordinal space - this appeals to me for several reasons - but more on that at a later date.

# The structure of invention

These series of posts are on the detail of transitions between different technologies. In future posts, this will touch on subjects such as *technical debt* or *obsolescence* but to start with I want to introduce some terminology from the work of others. 

The x-axis of a Wardley Map (Figure 1 below) measures the maturity of different component technologies \footnote{This is in principle done by assessing the language used to describe the technology in various corpora that refer to it, from publications, to patents, to standards bodies documentation, to marketing websites and so forth. I will write more on this in future posts.}

To start with, looking at Figure 1 we can see that we have a component moves from left to right as it matures. On the left in the *Genesis stage* it has been *kludged* together from existing components or assemblies of components. To give an example from \cite{Arthur page 131}, Lawrence's first [cyclotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron) was assembled from parts that included a kitchen chair, a clothes tree, window glass, sealing wax and brass fittings!  

The technology or component (I will use these terms interchangeably) then begins its journey along a path of development. This is shown by arrow going left to right in the Wardley Map.

As the component moves between different stages of maturity we can imagine think about the

Technologies consist of parts - assemblies or sub-assemblies - that are themselves technologies. W. Brian Arthur talks about the recursive structure of technologies. In \cite{} pp. he refers to
