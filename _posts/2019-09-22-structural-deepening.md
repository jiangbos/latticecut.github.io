## Preamble

I have been intending to write a blog for some time.

This is to help me understand my own ideas about the papers I read, talks I see, and increasingly importantly the social media threads I consume. 

As such, most of the material on this blog is just a reworking of other peoples ideas, perhaps in a different context, or with comparisons drawn with others work. I hope it is all referenced correctly. To this end, I am interested in feedback and input on clarifications, corrections, errata, emendations and so forth. 

I work in a cross section of different fields, from machine learning, to law, to education and 

In particular, I'm interested in a examining the detail of Simon Wardley's mapping framework in greater detail. Most of these early posts are going to be about interpreting many of the other works in the literature in the context of a map. For those, that don't know the background to this, begin reading [On being lost](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec) The appeal of this framework is that it views a business model as a directed graph in a metric or ordinal space - but more on that at a later date.

# The structure of invention

In general I wanted to do a series of posts on the detail of transitions between different technologies. In future posts, this will touch on subjects such as *technical debt* or *obsolescence* but to start with I need to put in place some basics. 

The x-axis of a Wardley Map measures the maturity of different component technologies. This is in principle done by assessing the language used to describe the technology in various corpora that refer to it, from publications, to patents, to standards bodies documentation, to marketing websites and so forth. I will write more on this in future posts. 

So to start with, looking at \ref{fig:component} we can see that we have a component
