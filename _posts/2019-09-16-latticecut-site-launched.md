Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. 

It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. 

Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. I used this tutorial to get started: [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) Thanks Hank!.
