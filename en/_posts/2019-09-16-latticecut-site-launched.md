Well.. I finally got around to putting this website together.

It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. I used this tutorial to get started: [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) Thanks Hank!.

I used this tutorial do get the multi-lingual site up: [Creating a Multilingual Blog With Jekyll](https://forestry.io/blog/creating-a-multilingual-blog-with-jekyll/)
