I am interested in the intersection of philosophy of science, machine learning and business strategy.

I currently lead on analytics activity at Mishcon de Reya and maintain an active teaching role at the UCL School of Management, focusing on business applications of Machine Learning. I also teach technology strategy at Peking University, Beijing on the international MBA programme.

I was on the founding team of UCL spin-out Satalia.com and venture backed Wearepopup.com

I have had several roles supporting innovation in the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and UCL and helped set up IDEALondon innovation centre with Cisco and EDF Energy.

I am interested in creating value from science and developing relationships between commercial partners and academia.
