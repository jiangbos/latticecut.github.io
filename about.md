I am interested in the intersection of philosophy of science, machine learning and business strategy.

I currently lead on analytics activity at [Mishcon de Reya](https://www.mishcon.com/) and maintain an active teaching role at the [UCL School of Management](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/), focusing on business applications of [Machine Learning](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/business-analytics). I also teach technology strategy at Peking University, Beijing on the international [MBA programme](https://en.bimba.pku.edu.cn/programmes/pkba/overviel/index.htm).

I am part of the founding team and board member of UCL spin-out [Satalia.com](https://www.satalia.com/) and venture backed [Wearepopup.com](http://wearepopup.com/)

I have had several roles supporting innovation in the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and UCL and helped set up [IDEALondon](https://www.idealondon.co.uk/) innovation centre with Cisco and EDF Energy.

I am interested in creating value from science and developing relationships between commercial partners and academia.
