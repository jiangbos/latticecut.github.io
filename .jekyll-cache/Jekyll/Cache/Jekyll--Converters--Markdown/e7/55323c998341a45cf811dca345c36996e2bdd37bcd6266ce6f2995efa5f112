I"‰<p>I have been intending to write a blog for some time.</p>

<p>This is to help me better understand my own ideas about the papers I read, talks I hear, and increasingly important, the social media threads I view.</p>

<p>As such, most of the material on this blog is just a reworking of other peoples ideas, perhaps in a different context, or with comparisons drawn with the work of others.</p>

<p>I hope it is all referenced correctly. To this end, I am interested in feedback and input on clarifications, corrections, errata, emendations and so forth.</p>

<p>This blog is focused on my interest in the different mechanisms of invention, innovation and the evolution of technology.</p>

<p>Most of my recent discussions in these matter have been with Dr Dave Chapman at the UCL School of Management where I teach courses on designing predictive systems (machine learning) and technology strategy.</p>
