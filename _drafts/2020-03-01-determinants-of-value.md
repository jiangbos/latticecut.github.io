# Determinants of value

To understand the developments in a focal technology and how different technologies compete for dominance we need to also consider developments in the technologies in the main assembly in which each of the focal technologies is embedded (Adner and Kapoor 2016[^adnerKapoor2016]).

One example of the physical limitations that the principle of lithography imposes is that as "developers press integrated circuits to become denser, therefore accommodating more [gates and logic]... at some point the process that produces them... becomes limited by the wavelength of light." (ibid p.133)[^arthur2009] Adding sub-systems to work around such limitations drives technologies to elaborate as they evolve - and as sub-systems or assemblies themselves are technologies, and they too develop so they enhance overall performance.

## An example of photo lithography

Let us look at the example of semiconductor photolithography in more detail, taken from Adner and Kapoor (Adner and Kapoor 2016[^adnerKapoor2016]). [Photolithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography) is the process by which a circuit design is imprinted on a semiconductor substrate called a wafer.

In Figure 5 you can see the value chain for photolithography tooling[^toolchain]. The *main principle* of lithography is to use light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask (also called an optical mask) to a photosensitive (that is, light-sensitive) chemical photoresist on the substrate. "The lithography process takes place when beams of energy originating from an “energy source” are directed onto the mask. The pattern on the mask allows a portion of the energy beams to pass through, with or without an optical “lens” system, onto the wafer. The wafer is coated with an energy sensitive “resist.” The resist undergoes a chemical reaction wherever the mask has allowed the energy to pass through. This chemical reaction changes the structure of the resist and allows its selective removal from the wafer. Another chemical process is then initiated in which the exposed parts of the wafer are etched. Finally, the remaining resist is removed, creating a final circuit that replicates the initial design."(ibid. p.632 [^adnerKapoor2016])

[^toolchain]: In practise, a semiconductor manufacturer may use scores of photolithography tools in a single production line, potentially costing tens of millions dollars each in a modern industrial setup.

The component used to aligning the lens and the energy source is referred to at the "lithography tool" which integrates with the mask and resist to create the main assembly. This can be seen in Figure 6. Tool manufacturers and their customers, the semi-conductor manufacturers, integrate these components to produce semiconductor chips for the device manufacturer, the end customer in this map.

### Proximal value

Now, we need to return briefly to the y-axis and think about the position of main-assembly as it evolves.

We have said that the y-axis of a Wardley Map displays the chain joining purposes to a principle to phenomena. In the same way that time is implicitly normalised[^stages] at the level of an individual component in the x-axis (so that components at the same stage of maturity have perhaps existed for very different periods of time) a similar mechanism can be used for the relative positioning of components on the y-axis.

Wardley sets out this notion as one of *visibility*. Components that are closer, or more visible, appear at the top of the map.  

The first thing to note is that serve a new purpose, or exploit a new principle, tend to appear higher on the axis.  

A map can be altered to the viewpoint of...



broadly speaking components appear on the top right of the map and transition as they evolve to the bottom right. The details dynamics and trajectories in the map, an patterns of behaviour, are our interest in the context of decision making and strategy.

value as a graph traversal problem

We are now in a position to revisit the distinction between the *as-developed* performance of a focal technology, and the *as-used performance* of the evolving assembly. However, to do so we need to

It the next post we'll look at different paths for the evolution of the main assembly to help us understand why some new technologies emerge and quickly supplant incumbent technologies while others take years or decades to take off.

We'll explore the framework of Adner and Kapoor (2016)[^adnerKapoor2016] that considers the co-evolution of competing focal technologies as well as assemblies in which they are embedded.
