# A blog to help me get some ideas down in written down

A blog using on Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites.

Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. I used this tutorial to get started: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ I used this tutorial to create a multilingual site: https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
